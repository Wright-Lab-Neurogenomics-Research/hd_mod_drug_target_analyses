# Project
This repository contains the R scripts and data required for the analyses performed by: Namuli *et al.* (2024) **"Genomic characterization of Huntington disease genetic modifiers informs drug target tractability"** (*Brain Communications*).

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains data used for analyses. Note some data sets are restricted access and have not been included in this folder (see description below). You will need to gain access to them yourselves.
- `scripts/`: R scripts used in the analysis and to generate figures.
  - `1_hd_mod_analyses_bc.R`: code to perform modifier gene-related analyses.
  - `2_repeat_gwas_comparison_bc.R`: code to compare the effect sizes of the top HD modifier variants in the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) modifier GWAS.
- `results/`: Contains the output figures generated by the scripts
